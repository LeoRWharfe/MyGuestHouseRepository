// Duplicate track items for seamless looping


// plan: photos section where images are in a horizontal loop, with description text below each image
// the loop should incriment between each image, pausing briefly for each image (image should be in the centre) before moving to the next one
// the loop should be infinite, so when the last image is reached, it should loop back to the first image seamlessly
// images that are not in the centre should be slightly faded out to give focus to the centred image, and scale 0.8x
// there should be arrow buttons on either side of the loop to manually move to the next/previous image
// the loop should also pause on hover, and resume when hover ends

// Bonus: add touch/swipe support for mobile devices
